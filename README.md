# Tools of Data Science

This repository contains the final graded assignment for the "Tools of Data Science" course on Coursera. The objective of this assignment is to create a Jupyter Notebook, insert code and markdown cells, and share the notebook through GitHub. 

## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. For this assignment, we will be creating a Jupyter Notebook to showcase our understanding of the tools of data science.

## Code and Markdown Cells

In the Jupyter Notebook, we will be using both code and markdown cells. Code cells allow us to write and execute code, while markdown cells allow us to write and format text. This combination of code and markdown cells makes the Jupyter Notebook an excellent tool for data exploration and analysis.

## Sharing the Notebook through GitHub

Once we have created our Jupyter Notebook, we will share it through GitHub. GitHub is a web-based platform that allows us to store and share our code with others. By sharing our notebook on GitHub, we can showcase our work to potential employers, colleagues, or anyone interested in data science.

## Conclusion

In this assignment, we have created a Jupyter Notebook, inserted code and markdown cells, and shared the notebook through GitHub. By completing this assignment, we have demonstrated our understanding of the tools of data science and our ability to use them effectively.
